# My asm projects

Recently I'd found a backup with my asm projects while I had been cleaning up my old USB
memory stick. I thought it would be cool to save them for future – the nostalgia and all
that.

This is a historical repository, all projects written in around 2008 - 2013 using flat
assembler compiler (http://flatassembler.net). They are probably don't compile now and I
don't have time and a Windows machine to check them and fix. And probably I don't want to.

Some projects have English grammatical mistakes and comments are written in Russian –
enjoy ;)
